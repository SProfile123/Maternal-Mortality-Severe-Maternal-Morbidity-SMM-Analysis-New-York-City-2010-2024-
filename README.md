# 🩺 Maternal Mortality & Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM) Analysis – NYC (2010–2024)

## 📖 Project Description
Maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity (SMM) remain urgent public health challenges in New York City, with persistent disparities across boroughs and racial/ethnic groups. This project analyzes maternal mortality data from 2010–2024 to uncover trends, underlying causes, and equity gaps. Using **Python, R, SAS, and Tableau**, the project applies both quantitative methods (deaths, borough-level disparities, race/ethnicity analysis) and qualitative methods (MAXQDA-style text mining of underlying causes) to generate policy-ready insights aligned with **New York State’s Prevention Agenda 2025–2030**.

## 📊 Tools & Methods
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly)** → Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations  
- **R (tidyverse, ggplot2, tidytext, wordcloud)** → Statistical summaries, word clouds, and qualitative theme extraction  
- **SAS** → Data import, cleaning, and reporting workflows  
- **Tableau** → Interactive dashboards for trends, borough disparities, and cause analysis  
- **MAXQDA-style qualitative analysis** → Text mining of underlying cause narratives for key themes

## 📈 Key Outputs
- **Trends:** Maternal deaths over time by race/ethnicity (2010–2024)  
- **Geographic disparities:** Borough-level comparisons showing inequities  
- **Causes:** Leading contributors including hemorrhage, hypertension, and infection  
- **Qualitative themes:** Word cloud and frequency tables of underlying causes  
- **Tableau Dashboards:** Interactive exploration of trends, disparities, and causes

## 🏥 Policy Implications
- Expand perinatal care access in high-risk boroughs (Bronx, Brooklyn)  
- Strengthen hospital quality improvement targeting SMM events  
- Fund culturally appropriate, community-based maternal health equity programs  
- Align with **New York State Prevention Agenda 2025–2030**
